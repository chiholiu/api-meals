## Random meal api

Fetch the api and then create a button that will call this api call.
When the api has been called, the component should cluster all the matching and exisiting key names with values and output that. In my perspective this part must be a reusable component so we can use this again for the second part of this app. 

## Search api

First of all we need to fetch an api.
Then we must get input value which outputs a bunch of ingredients.
Each ingredient should be clickable.

#Writing tests
When each component has been written in a maintainable and reusable way, then the next step is to write a test in Jest
